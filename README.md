## OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING THROUGH JAVA LAB
### Lists of Experiments

1.   Try debug step by step with small program of about 10 to 15 lines which contains at least one if else condition and a for loop(Printing Prime numbers in a given range). [CODE](Prime.java)

2.   Write a Java program that works as a simple calculator. Use a grid layout to arrange buttons for the digits and for the +, -,*, % operations. Add a text field to display the result. Handle any possible exceptions like divided by zero. [CODE](operation.java)

3.   A) Develop an applet in Java that displays a simple message.

     B) Develop an applet in Java that receives an integer in one text field, and computes its factorialValue and returns it in another   text field, when the button named “Compute” is clicked.

4.   Write a Java program that creates a user interface to perform integer divisions. The user enters two numbers in the text fields, Num1 and Num2. The division of Num1 and Num 2 is displayed in the Resultfield when the Divide button is clicked. If Num1 or Num2 were not an integer, the program would throw a Number Format Exception. If Num2 were Zero, the program would throw an Arithmetic Exception.Display the exception in a message dialog box.

5.   Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. First thread generates a random integer every 1 second and if the value is even, the second thread computes the square of the number and prints. If the value is odd, the third thread will print the value of the cube of the number.
6.   Write a Java program for the following:

        (1)Create a doubly linked list of elements.

        (2)Delete a given element from the above list.

        (3)Display the contents of the list after deletion.

7.   Write a Java program that simulates a traffic light. The program lets the user select one of three lights: red, yellow, or green with radio buttons. On selecting a button, an appropriate message with “Stop” or “Ready” or “Go” should appear above the buttons in the selected color. Initially, there is no message shown.

8.   Write a Java program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains two integers and an empty method named print Area (). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle such 
that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only the method print Area () that prints the area of the given shape.

9. Suppose that a table named Table.txt is stored in a text file. The first line in the file is the header, and the remaining lines correspond to rows in the table. The elements are separated by commas.
Write a java program to display the table using Labels in Grid Layout.

10. Write a Java program that handles all mouse events and shows the event name at the center of the window when a mouse event is fired (Use Adapter classes).

11. Write a Java program that loads names and phone numbers from a text file where the data isorganized as one line per record and each field in a record are separated by a tab (\t). It takes aname or phone number as input and prints the corresponding other value from the hash table (hint:use hash tables).

12. Write a Java program that correctly implementsthe producer – consumer problem using theconcept of inter thread communication.

13. Write a Java program to list all the files in a directory including the files present in all its subdirectories.
